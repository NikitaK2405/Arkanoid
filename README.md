# Arkanoid
This is a simple game made with Python. I recommend you play the original Arkanoid first.  It's much more fun than mine :)
Download DOSBox to run original Arkanoid, because it's an MS-DOS executable file.

About my game:
1. You can move your paddle by moving the mouse or pressing left/right arrows.
2. The ball reflection angle depends on the difference between center of the paddle and ball position.
3. When the ball touches the paddle, it accelerates.
4. You can pause the game by pressing Escape. You can choose items using specified buttons or just clicking on them.
5. If you want to play a bit faster, press X - the ball accelerates twice. Press X again to slow the ball down.
6. Switch between light and dark themes by "T" key.
7. You can move the paddle up/down with mouse wheel or pressing up/down arrows (beta feature).
8. If you have found any bugs or undeclared features, let me know: pakanini24@gmail.com. Thanks for playing!
